    <h2>Abstract</h2>
    <p>
      We propose a conceptual framework for the Collatz hypothesis based on global balance in closed discrete systems.
      This approach models the iterative process as a conservative exchange of "units" among elements, showing that unbounded trajectories are impossible without external input. The result is a universal principle that naturally leads to convergence or cycles within the Collatz dynamics.
    </p>

    <h2>Axioms and Setup</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Consider a closed system of natural numbers: \( S = \{n_1, n_2, ..., n_k\} \).</li>
      <li>At each step, for each \( n_i \):
        <ul>
          <li>If \( n_i \) is even: \( n_i \to n_i/2 \).</li>
          <li>If \( n_i \) is odd: \( n_i \to 3n_i + 1 \).</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>All changes occur <b>only</b> within the system; there are no external sources or sinks.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Operator of Change (Exchange Function)</h2>
    <p>
      For each time step \( t \), define the change for every \( n_i \):<br>
      \( \Delta n_i^{(t)} = n_i^{(t+1)} - n_i^{(t)} \)
    </p>

    <h2>Global Balance Law</h2>
    <p>
      The sum of all changes in the system at every step is zero:<br>
      \[
        \sum_{i=1}^{k} \Delta n_i^{(t)} = 0
      \]<br>
      This models the conservation law: any increase for one element is balanced by an equal decrease elsewhere.
    </p>

    <h2>Consequence: No Unbounded Growth</h2>
    <p>
      Suppose, for contradiction, that some trajectory could grow without bound.
      This would require a persistent influx of "units" for at least one \( n_j \).
      But since the system is closed, these units must come from other elements, which are all natural numbers (non-negative).
      Continued growth of one element necessarily depletes others, but no element can become negative.
      Therefore, perpetual, unbounded growth is impossible.
    </p>

    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <p>
      In any closed system governed by the Collatz rules and the global balance law, no unboundedly increasing trajectories can exist.
      All dynamics must converge to a finite cycle or a stable point.
    </p>

    <h2>Theorem (Balance Formulation)</h2>
    <blockquote>
      In a closed discrete system where every change is internally balanced according to the Collatz process, all trajectories converge to a finite cycle or stabilize; unbounded growth is impossible.
    </blockquote>

    <h2>Notes</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>This is a principle-based explanation—if further formalized and connected with traditional number-theoretic tools, it may provide a pathway to a full proof of the Collatz conjecture.</li>
      <li>The approach generalizes to any discrete process with a global conservation law.</li>
    </ul>
